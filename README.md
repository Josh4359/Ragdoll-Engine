for help, questions, and a bunch of cool people (im there too):

this project is kind of a mess; its been in development for waaay too long and after my programming style has evolved over time some parts of the code have gotten more outdated than others, so quality and consistency will vary across the project. i personally wont be using this in future projects; its gotten a little too messy and i think i could do a lot better now that im a little more experienced

ill try to keep updating it tho as i will still be working on some parts like the behaviour graph and spline importer, which might allow me to clean things up in some other areas of the project as well. id also like to add just a few more features since a lot was cut due to time, such as braking, drop dash, bounce, air dash, sidestep, and like a million other things

anyway as self conscious as i am about some of the code it really isnt that bad and works well enough. i hope someone will still find it useful in their games. also if u need any help or just want to make fun of me for my bad code consider joining the discord which ive spammed practically everywhere at this point so im sure it wont be too big of a challenge to find it

also there do seem to be a few memory leaks which i think have something to do with the behaviour graph but ive been too lazy to debug them so just deal with it itll be fine ur computer isnt gonna explode or anything
